# 09 An HTML generator using Node.JS

## Description
This is a quick Node.JS app that creates an HTML file based on user prompts. This is a command-line app asks for information about a Team and its team members. And then it renders a beautiful index.html page with the team members as cards in a responsive UI.

## Installation
This app uses [INQUIRER](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), [FS](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html), and [PATH](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html). 

For this specific app, we'll only install the three mentioned above:

```
npm install inquirer
```

```
npm install fs
```

```
npm install path
```

Optionally, it is possibl to install all NPM modules:

```
npm install 
```

## Usage
In order to run the application, users only need to run the index.js file. This is a super short file that calls the main class: Team, which takes care of the question prompting and storing all the data in an object.

``` 
node index
```
For reference, here are the contents of index.js (extremely self-explanatory, I know...):

```
const Team = require('./lib/Team');

new Team().initializeTeam();
```

Now, the method initializeTeam from the object Team will be called. The pseudocode goes more or less like this:

* Initialize the Team: Ask for team name
* Ask for the details of an employee:
  * Ask for role
  * Ask for name
  * Ask for e-mail
  * Ask for additional details depending on role:
    * Manager: office phone number
    * Engineer: GitHub handle
    * Intern: School
* Ask the user if they want to add another employee

Keep doing this until the user says No. Click on the image below to see the app in action!

Et voilÃ¡, here's the actual final result (Click on the image to see the working result video):

## Code

The superclass of this app is Employee. All other employee types: Manager, Engineer, and Internal extend this class. 

Superclass Employee:
![Employee](./employee.png)

Manager class extending Employee:
![Manager](./manager.png)

## Tests

Test suites were created for all four classes. These are available on the **\__test\__** folder. Here are the test results (Click on the image to see a video of the tests running):

[![Watch the app in action](./tests.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12m7eNtoZwPxticy5__Usv_N4rvAAV3Zh/view)

Each test validates all properties and methos of each class. For example: Employee.test.js:

```
const Employee = require('../lib/Employee.js');

test('Creates a random Employee object', () => {
    const employee = new Employee(594,'George Contanza','George@NoSoupForYou.com');
    expect(employee.getId()).toEqual(expect.any(Number));
    expect(employee.getName()).toEqual(expect.any(String));
    expect(employee.getName().length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(employee.getEmail()).toEqual(expect.any(String));
    expect(employee.getEmail().length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(employee.getRole()).toEqual('Employee');
});
```
